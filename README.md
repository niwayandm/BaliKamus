# BaliKamus

This project was made for my scientific research assignment as a student at Gunadarma University. I made an Android app that can translate Balinese to English and vice versa with OCR. The app was made with Flutter using Google's [ML Kit](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit) and the words database was made with SQLite.
